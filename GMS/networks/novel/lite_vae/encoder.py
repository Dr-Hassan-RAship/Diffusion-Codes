"""
Notes:
1) The input channels to each feature extracter is 12 (page 20 of paper) and output channels is also 12. This is because from now we will use their implementation of haar transform.
The difference between their implementation and ours is that we applied the haar transform to the first channel of the RGB image across the batch resulting in (B, 4, H_l, W_l). However
their implementation uses ptwt instead of pywt which takes the whole RGB image and hence the output of each level transform is (B, 4 * 3 = 12, H_l, W_l)

2) The following is the model_channels and ch_multiples configuration for each model size of the feature extraction module
    For LiteVAE-S, model_channels = 16 and ch_multiplies = [1, 2, 2] (see unet_block.py)
    For LiteVAE-B, model_channels = 32 and ch_multiplies = [1, 2, 3]
    For LiteVAE-M, model_channels = 64 and ch_multiplies = [1, 2, 4]
    For LiteVAE-L, model_channels = 64 and ch_multiplies = [1, 2, 4]

3) Due to similar reasoning as 1), the feature aggregation module which was previously taking in_channels as in_channels * 3 and out_channels as out_channels * 2 is now going to take
   in_channels = 12 * 3 = 36 but out_channels can be flexible. The paper has used 12 (page 7 of paper). We will use 8 as the mu | logvar decomposition allows us to have the latent
   in 4 channels form which is what the LMM model expects in GMS paper

4) The following is the model_channels and ch_multiples configuration for each model size of the feature aggregation module
    For LiteVAE-S, model_channels = 16 and ch_multiplies = [1, 2, 2] (see unet_block.py)
    For LiteVAE-B, model_channels = 32 and ch_multiplies = [1, 2, 3]
    For LiteVAE-M, model_channels = 64 and ch_multiplies = [1, 2, 3]
    For LiteVAE-L, model_channels = 64 and ch_multiplies = [1, 2, 4]

5) Other Training configurations:
    i) Adam Optimizer with base LR = 10^-4 and (beta1, beta2) = (0.5, 0.9)
